Currently this code is intended for a endothermic reaction given it 
located the minimum within the function. That being said I do not 
have the data to test it to see if its accurate but a exothermic 
version of it worked when refrencing a polynomial.

We got endothermic data and it works beautifully - I think...
I need to find a way to refrence the shape factor
